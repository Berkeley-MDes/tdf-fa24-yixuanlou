# Week 1: Report 1 #
## Week of 09/04/2024

This week, I reviewed the outline, learned the basics of laser cutting and 3D printing, and completed the quiz. I also downloaded Rhino and started playing with Grasshopper. Since I’m not very familiar with it, I signed up for a Grasshopper workshop.

# Week 2: Report 1 #
## Week of 09/11/2024

This week, I focused on adjusting the parameters for a phone stand model. I discovered that some changes resulted in noticeable variations, while others caused errors (I now understand that red indicates an error). After asking a classmate for help, I learned that pressing a specific button can reveal the function of certain components, which was very helpful in troubleshooting.

I followed a tutorial to create my own model, which was my first time working with Grasshopper. I realized that it operates much like a programming environment. During this process, I familiarized myself with concepts like "flatten" and "bake," and successfully created an object. I also explored a range of other features within the software.

Additionally, I attended a 3D printing lecture. I’m excited about the possibility of one day printing a 3D object that I’ve designed myself.
